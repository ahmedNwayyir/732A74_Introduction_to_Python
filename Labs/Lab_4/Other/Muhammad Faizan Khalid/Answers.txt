Q1. The function clearLine does all the work for cleaning text, funciton also has the capbility to divide the text into words after cleaning the text.
     The actual text is left unaffected. Our sript generates a whitelist which includes the allowable characters and all the text which is outside the whitelist is removed. 
     The lines splitted on space and words are used for different tasks

 Q2. The data structure we used is dictionary because with dictionary can program speed is efficient. 
     This is for cases that are used for supplying multiple parameters, the builin functions to work on ditionaries are easy.
	 Dictionaries are basically hash tables and implemented as a key value pair. Keys can be of any datatype 
     Its useful to retrieve the values based on their keys, when there is no particular order in the dictionary values.  
     indexing like in dictionaries is not possible. through this we can fetch values of different keys and its value.
