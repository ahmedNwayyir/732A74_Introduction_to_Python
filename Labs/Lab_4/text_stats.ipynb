CapturedOutput also has a show()\n                    method for displaying the output, and __call__ as well, so you\n                    can use that to quickly display the output. If unspecified,\n                    captured output is discarded.\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      --no-stderr   Don't capture stderr.\n      --no-stdout   Don't capture stdout.\n      --no-display  Don't capture IPython's rich display.\n%%cmd:\n    %%cmd script magic\n    \n    Run cells with cmd in a subprocess.\n    \n    This is a shortcut for `%%script cmd`\n%%debug:\n    ::\n    \n      %debug [--breakpoint FILE:LINE] [statement [statement ...]]\n    \n    Activate the interactive debugger.\n    \n    This magic command support two ways of activating debugger.\n    One is to activate debugger before executing code.  This way, you\n    can set a break point, to step through the code from the point.\n    You can use this mode by giving statements to execute and optionally\n    a breakpoint.\n    \n    The other one is to activate debugger in post-mortem mode.  You can\n    activate this mode simply running %debug without any argument.\n    If an exception has just occurred, this lets you inspect its stack\n    frames interactively.  Note that this will always work only on the last\n    traceback that occurred, so you must call this quickly after an\n    exception that you wish to inspect has fired, because if another one\n    occurs, it clobbers the previous one.\n    \n    If you want IPython to automatically do this on every exception, see\n    the %pdb magic for more details.\n    \n    .. versionchanged:: 7.3\n        When running code, user variables are no longer expanded,\n        the magic line is always left unmodified.\n    \n    positional arguments:\n      statement             Code to run in debugger. You can omit this in cell\n                            magic mode.\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      --breakpoint <FILE:LINE>, -b <FILE:LINE>\n                            Set break point at LINE in FILE.\n%%file:\n    Alias for `%%writefile`.\n%%html:\n    ::\n    \n      %html [--isolated]\n    \n    Render the cell as a block of HTML\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      --isolated  Annotate the cell as 'isolated'.

In the Jupyter Notebook, this magic only renders the subset\n    of latex defined by MathJax\n    [here](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/v2.5-latest/tex.html).\n%%markdown:\n    Render the cell as Markdown text block\n%%perl:\n    %%perl script magic\n    \n    Run cells with perl in a subprocess.\n    \n    This is a shortcut for `%%script perl`\n%%prun:\n    Run a statement through the python code profiler.\n    \n    Usage, in line mode:\n      %prun [options] statement\n    \n    Usage, in cell mode:\n      %%prun [options] [statement]\n      code...\n      code...\n    \n    In cell mode, the additional code lines are appended to the (possibly\n    empty) statement in the first line.  Cell mode allows you to easily\n    profile multiline blocks without having to put them in a separate\n    function.\n    \n    The given statement (which doesn't require quote marks) is run via the\n    python profiler in a manner similar to the profile.run() function.\n    Namespaces are internally managed to work correctly; profile.run\n    cannot be used in IPython because it makes certain assumptions about\n    namespaces which do not hold under IPython.\n    \n    Options:\n    \n    -l <limit>\n      you can place restrictions on what or how much of the\n      profile gets printed. The limit value can be:\n    \n         * A string: only information for function names containing this string\n           is printed.\n    \n         * An integer: only these many lines are printed.\n    \n         * A float (between 0 and 1): this fraction of the report is printed\n           (for example, use a limit of 0.4 to see the topmost 40% only).\n    \n      You can combine several limits with repeated use of the option. For\n      example, ``-l __init__ -l 5`` will print only the topmost 5 lines of\n      information about class constructors.\n    \n    -r\n      return the pstats.Stats object generated by the profiling. This\n      object has all the information about the profile in it, and you can\n      later use it for further analysis or in other functions.\n    \n    -s <key>\n      sort profile by given key. You can provide more than one key\n      by using the option several times: '-s key1 -s key2 -s key3...'. The\n      default sorting key is 'time'.\n    \n      The following is copied verbatim from the profile documentation\n      referenced below:\n    \n      When more than one key is provided, additional keys are used as\n      secondary criteria when the there is equality in all keys selected\n      before them.\n    \n      Abbreviations can be used for any key names, as long as the\n      abbreviation is unambiguous.  The following are the keys currently\n      defined:\n    \n      ============  =====================\n      Valid Arg     Meaning\n      ============  =====================\n      \"calls\"       call count\n      \"cumulative\"  cumulative time\n      \"file\"        file name\n      \"module\"      file name\n      \"pcalls\"      primitive call count\n      \"line\"        line number\n      \"name\"        function name\n      \"nfl\"         name/file/line\n      \"stdname\"     standard name\n      \"time\"        internal time\n      ============  =====================\n    \n      Note that all sorts on statistics are in descending order (placing\n      most time consuming items first), where as name, file, and line number\n      searches are in ascending order (i.e., alphabetical). The subtle\n      distinction between \"nfl\" and \"stdname\" is that the standard name is a\n      sort of the name as printed, which means that the embedded line\n      numbers get compared in an odd way.  For example, lines 3, 20, and 40\n      would (if the file names were the same) appear in the string order\n      \"20\" \"3\" and \"40\".  In contrast, \"nfl\" does a numeric compare of the\n      line numbers.  In fact, sort_stats(\"nfl\") is the same as\n      sort_stats(\"name\", \"file\", \"line\").\n    \n    -T <filename>\n      save profile results as shown on screen to a text\n      file. The profile is still shown on screen.\n    \n    -D <filename>\n      save (via dump_stats) profile statistics to given\n      filename. This data is in a format understood by the pstats module, and\n      is generated by a call to the dump_stats() method of profile\n      objects. The profile is still shown on screen.\n    \n    -q\n      suppress output to the pager.  Best used with -T and/or -D above.\n    \n    If you want to run complete programs under the profiler's control, use\n    ``%run -p [prof_opts] filename.py [args to program]`` where prof_opts\n    contains profiler specific options as described here.\n    \n    You can read the complete documentation for the profile module with::\n    \n      In [1]: import profile; profile.help()\n    \n    .. versionchanged:: 7.3\n        User variables are no longer expanded,\n        the magic line is always left unmodified.\n%%pypy:\n    %%pypy script magic\n    \n    Run cells with pypy in a subprocess.\n    \n    This is a shortcut for `%%script pypy`\n%%python:\n    %%python script magic\n    \n    Run cells with python in a subprocess.\n    \n    This is a shortcut for `%%script python`\n%%python2:\n    %%python2 script magic\n    \n    Run cells with python2 in a subprocess.\n    \n    This is a shortcut for `%%script python2`\n%%python3:\n    %%python3 script magic\n    \n    Run cells with python3 in a subprocess.\n    \n    This is a shortcut for `%%script python3`\n%%ruby:\n    %%ruby script magic\n    \n    Run cells with ruby in a subprocess.\n    \n    This is a shortcut for `%%script ruby`\n%%script:\n    ::\n    \n      %shebang [--no-raise-error] [--proc PROC] [--bg] [--err ERR] [--out OUT]\n    \n    Run a cell via a shell command\n    \n    The `%%script` line is like the #! line of script,\n    specifying a program (bash, perl, ruby, etc.) with which to run.\n    \n    The rest of the cell is run by that program.\n    \n    Examples\n    --------\n    ::\n    \n        In [1]: %%script bash\n           ...: for i in 1 2 3; do\n           ...:   echo $i\n           ...: done\n        1\n        2\n        3\n    \n    optional arguments:\n      --no-raise-error  Whether you should raise an error message in addition to a\n                        stream on stderr if you get a nonzero exit code.\n      --proc PROC       The variable in which to store Popen instance.
