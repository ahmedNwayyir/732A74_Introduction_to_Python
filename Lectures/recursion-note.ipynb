    "Recursion is the main way of creating repeated operations in functional programming. It consists of functions calling themselves, instead of using iterative constructs such as `while`- or `for`-loops which implicity require some kind of state. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is generally a more mathematical way of defining operations and many famous mathematical functions, such as the Fibonacci function, have a recursive definition, even though they usually can be implemented iteratively. Below we will use a toy example as a way of introducing linear recursion. This might be of particular interest if you haven't taken undergraduate programming (or theory of computation)."

More practical examples of recursive functions or recursive identities abound in eg network optimisation, traversing decision trees (in machine learning), analysing text structure, programs, and the like. It is not also unusual that a recursive identity is given a fast imperative implementation. So whereas Pythonic code seldom overuses explicit recursion, or pure recursive functions (plenty of recursive traversal over tree structures might take place, but not in a purely functional manner), it is useful to know."
